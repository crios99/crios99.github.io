    <h1>Nursing Today</h1>
    <img src="images/Nursing Today.png" alt="Nursing Today Logo" />
    <p>Nursing is one of the most important jobs in the world. 
        There are 4.2 million registered nurses in the United States, 
        with many more joining each year. 
        These Women and Men work tirelessly to provide for their patients everyday. 
        That is why we believe that anyway we can help to make their lives easier is something we should do. 
        Nurses help save lives everyday, and deserve to do so comfortably. 
        This website was built to help nurses as well as family and friends find good quality products to use for work or give as a gift, 
        there's nothing worse than buying a gift and that person never using it. 
        Whether it is a nice pair of shoes or a funny badge reel, these are products that come highly recommended by all including nurses. 
        Each product on here will link directly to the companies website or 
        amazon page to support the companies as well as to make finding the products much easier, for example <a href="https://www.hoka.com/en/us/">This will take you to the Hoka Home Page</a></p>
